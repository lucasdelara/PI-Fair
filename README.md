# PI-Fair
Python code to learn optimal-transport-based counterfactual models and apply them to fair classification.

It implements the learning procedure from the paper Transport-based Counterfactual Models (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13025.pdf).

The Notebook demo_adult.ipynb runs experiments on the Adult Census Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).
